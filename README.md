# üñ•Ô∏è STM32F407 + ILI9341 2.4" LCD (SPI) Communication

This project demonstrates how to communicate with a 2.4" TFT LCD using the **ILI9341 controller** via **SPI interface** on the **STM32F407** microcontroller.

It's built for **learning purposes**, focusing on how SPI communication works and how to interface with graphical displays at a low level.

### üìò Lessons Learned

Throughout this project, I encountered several interesting challenges and gained valuable insights into working with STM32 and SPI-based LCDs. Here are some of the key lessons learned:

---

#### HAL SPI Issues at Low Clock Speeds

- Initially, I used the internal **HSI (16 MHz)** with SPI configured at **1‚Äì2 MHz**. Although the logic analyzer showed that all SPI commands were sent correctly using the STM32 HAL API, the LCD did not initialize or display properly. To debug this, I modified `lcd_send_command()` and `lcd_send_data()` to use **register-level access** instead of HAL functions ‚Äî and this **worked** with SPI at 1‚Äì2 MHz. Then I realized that the **low SPI speed** might be the root cause of the issue. So I switched the system clock source to **PLL at 168 MHz**, and surprisingly, the **HAL SPI API** started working as expected.
- Update on next few days:
Root cause: the real root cause of this is not about SPI spread, it is because of bugs in `lcd_send_data()` function. After fixing `lcd_send_data()` the LCD start to work with 1-2MHz SPI but of course low FPS
---

#### Unable to Read Data from LCD (e.g., ID, Status)

I attempted to read data from the LCD (e.g., display **ID** and **status registers**), but failed to get valid responses.  
I'm still unsure whether this is due to:

- Hardware limitations of the LCD module, or  
- Issues in my **SPI read implementation**

Further investigation is required.

---

#### 16-bit Write with HAL API Unclear

In the `lcd_write()` function, I needed to send **16-bit data** to the LCD.

However, I couldn't get `HAL_SPI_Transmit()` to work properly with **16-bit transfers** using a `uint8_t *` buffer. As a result, I had to fall back to **direct register-level SPI access** to manually transmit the data.

This part still needs improvement, or at least a clearer understanding of how to configure **HAL SPI** to transmit 16-bit values using an 8-bit buffer.
